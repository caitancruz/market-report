Market Saturation: Re-releases and mass production can dilute the rarity and desirability of some items.
Limited Regulation: Lack of formal oversight in secondary markets raises concerns about fraud and consumer protection.
These constraints may temper market expansion if not addressed through transparent trading practices and improved verification mechanisms.
