Market Challenges to Consider
Despite optimistic growth, the market faces several challenges. One major issue is the lack of standardization in seller refurbishing processes. While certified refurbishment involves stringent checks, seller refurbishment varies significantly, which may affect consumer confidence.
Additionally, limited warranty offerings on refurbished products compared to new ones can deter some buyers, especially in regions where consumer protection laws for pre-owned goods are minimal.
