Supply Chain and Production Analysis
While the Philippines produces coffee domestically, it still imports a significant portion of its supply, primarily instant coffee. Robusta remains the dominant crop, but Arabica and Liberica (Barako) varieties are gaining traction due to their unique flavors and rising demand among specialty roasters.
Efforts to boost local coffee production include government and private-sector investments in farm mechanization, farmer training, and sustainable practices. These initiatives aim to reduce dependency on imports, increase productivity, and ensure consistent bean quality across regions.

Production hubs include Benguet (Arabica), Cavite (Liberica), and Sultan Kudarat (Robusta)
Post-harvest handling and quality control remain key challenges
Growing demand for traceable and ethically sourced beans
